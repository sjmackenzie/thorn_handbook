## the thorn handbook

The Thorn Handbook is a web application for activists and other radical travelers. 

It will serve two functions. First, it will archive and document the useful resources of a place geographically. This will serve as an annotated map of a locale whose content can be searched and filtered by a traveler based on their specific needs. Second, it will be a site for real-time use. By allowing interested but unaffiliated parties to subscribe to email lists, rss feeds, and other updates related to a particular project, The Thorn Handbook will create temporary, interest-based resource networks around acheiving shared goals.

### static thorn (what I'm working on now)

1. Create interface for annotating a map with location-specific content. 
   1a. Accumulate resources to populate the map.
   1b. create text-based interface for speed or mass uploads.

2. Create interface for connecting content in map with content in traveler's story.
   2a. Allow for real-time context viewing; look into Aperture.

3. Create search utility for the resource listings and their display on map.

4. Accomodate uploading and annoatating other file forms to the map (i.e. pdfs, pictures, etc.). 

### real time thorn (what I'll be working on when I learn to program much better)

5. Design webpages to chronologically display blog posts, twitters, and emails about a project while it is happening.

6. Create a user system so that people can be added to mailing lists, decide to track projects, contact other activists, etc.
