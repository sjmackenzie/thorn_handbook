I wanted to go to ETech 2008, but I couldn't afford a ticket and
hotel.  So, I decided to fly there and see if I could finagle my way
in.  It was being held at the ###.  I arrived, and started hanging out
with the early arrival participants.  At some point, I lifted one of
the member's passes and went to the business center, where I scanned
and printed the pass.  Before that, I had gone to the concierge and
looked on their guest roster (the computer screen is easy to see) for
a name and room number.  I gave that name and room number at the
business center, took the pass, and went to the information desk for
the conference, saying that I had lost my lanyard.  A few minutes
later, I had an apparently bona fide pass with my name on it.  After
joining the facebook conference group, I received copies of all the
emails sent to attendees and all the changes of schedule, etc.  It's
worth noting that I was in a set of slacks and a dress shirt for the
conference, and that I think this helped immensely the two times (the
information desk, and in one of the VIP conference rooms) that I was
confronted about my name not being on the list.  Acting annoyed but
gracious in the VIP room was enough to get my name added to the list,
at which point I was equivalent to conference participants in access.

Remaining to be solved was the housing problem.  Knowing ahead of time
that this would be an issue, I took two blankets from my flight and
kept them with me.  The first night I tried sleeping on the couch in
front of the shoe repair shop, but twice hotel staff woke me and
instructed me to go back to my room.  Note that here, having a guest
name and room came in handy, again.  The second night I went to the
second floor (on which the conference was being held) and when I went
to the bathroom, noticed that the doors went down to the floor.  The
handicapped bathroom had enough space to sleep in, and so around 2AM
the cleaning staff finish, and after they came out, I would go to the
handicapped restroom and sleep there until the cleaning staff came in
at around 8AM.

In this way, I got through ETech 2008 and had a great time!

I didn't know how to make anything. I knew there were cool things out
there but I was struggling just to get a passing grade. I'd be lucky
to get a _fun_ & _useful_ & _flexible_ job in the real world. My
actual luck came from a guy  called Marcos, who answered a call for
help on a side-project I was roped into doing.
